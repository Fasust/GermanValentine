### A 2D Pixel Art Game build for Android with Unity 2D

This game was built for the module Digital Design 2018 at Westerdals Oslo ACT.
We were free to choose any design project within the topic “Where are you from” and I choose to build a game focusing on my favorite german tradition.

## The Tradition
The german “Liebesmaien” tradition, which is celebrated on the first of May is in its essence very close to the more well known Valentines day. But instead of chocolate, german bachelors go out into the woods to chop down trees, dress them up and then secretly place them at the houses of their crushes. 

## The Game
The game is split into 3 parts, each representing one of the 3 phases of the tradition.

### Stealing the tree

### Dressing it (carving a heart from wood)

### Bringing it to your crushes house

I created all used sprites and most of the sound effects myself. This is the most animation work I have done for a project so far and I am very pleased with the result. 
All in all, this was a great opportunity to learn Unity and get some more experience in digital design.
