This game was built for the module Digital Design 2018 at Westerdals Oslo ACT.
We were free to choose any design project within the topic ‚ÄúWhere are you from‚Äù and I choose to build a game focusing on my favorite german tradition.

## The Tradition
The german ‚ÄúLiebesmaien‚Äù tradition is celebrated on the first of May. It is in its essence very close to the more well-known _Valentines day_. But instead of chocolate, german bachelors go out into the woods to chop down trees, dress them up and then secretly place them at the houses of their crushes. 

## The Game
The game is split into 2 parts, each representing a part of the tradition:

### Stealing the tree

### Bringing it to your crushes house

### Goal
The Goal of the game is to deliver your tree with the highest score possible. Your score is affected by your **speed**, the **quality of the tree you pick** and how well you can **throw it onto the roof of your crush**.

## Creation
I created all used sprites and most of the sound effects myself. This is the most animation work I have done for a project so far and I am very pleased with the result. 
All in all, this was a great opportunity to learn Unity and get some more experience in digital design.
